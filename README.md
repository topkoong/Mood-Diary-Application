# Mood-Diary-Application
Mood Diary is a simple, effective, and personal application because you can manage all your thoughts with Mood diary, and you are capable of storing journal entries, photos, and voice memos. Also, you are able to record your special events, normal events, and thoughts and feelings. This is a kind of therapy after bad days given that you can understand things you could have done better thereby assessing your mistakes when writing something down and considering it. In addition, you are able to appreciate your success by writing down a challenge you overcame and how you did it. Functions of this application software are to perform specific operations for the convenience of users such as adding or editing diary, getting userâ€™s current location, finding titles by keyword, recording audio as well as sharing their stories to social media eg. Twitter and Facebook. To implement this project, we used CoreData, AVAFoundation, MapKit, CoreLocation Framework, ImagePicker, and Social Framework, and Model View Controller pattern in this application.
